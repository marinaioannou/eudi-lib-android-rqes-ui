## Overview

This module provides core and UI functionality for the EUDI Wallet, focused on the
**Remote Qualified Electronic Signature (RQES)** service. RQES allows users to sign
documents using a qualified certificate held remotely by a Qualified Trust Service
Provider (QTSP).

The SDK supports two flows:

- **Local file flow** — the host app already has a local document (PDF) selected and
  asks the SDK to sign it.
- **Remote URL flow** — the host app receives a remote URL (typically via a deep link
  or QR code) which the SDK resolves to a document and then signs.

It ships ready-made Jetpack Compose screens for QTSP selection, certificate selection,
document preview, and a success/sharing screen, plus the orchestration around OAuth
authorization, credential authorization, signing, and sharing the signed document.

You configure the SDK at compile time via the `EudiRQESUiConfig` interface and drive
it at runtime through the `EudiRQESUi` object.

### What the SDK shows the user

- **Options selection screen** — pick the QTSP and signing certificate.
- **View document screen** — preview the original or signed PDF.
- **Success screen** — confirm the signed document and share it.

    Host->>SDK: initiate(documentUri | remoteUri)
    SDK-->>Host: launches signing UI
    SDK->>Browser: opens OAuth authorization URL
    Browser->>QTSP: user authenticates
    QTSP-->>Host: deep link with authorization code (via browser redirect)
    Host->>SDK: resume(authorizationCode)
    SDK->>QTSP: sign document
    QTSP-->>SDK: signed document
    SDK-->>Host: Success screen
```

## Requirements

- Android 10 (API level 29) or higher
- Java 17 (the SDK is compiled with `JvmTarget.JVM_17`)
- A Kotlin host app is recommended — the public API uses Kotlin `value class` types
  (`DocumentUri`, `RemoteUri`). The SDK ships its own Jetpack Compose UI, so your app
  does **not** need to use Compose itself.

## Installation

The library is published on Maven Central. Add the dependency to your app's
`build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("eu.europa.ec.eudi:eudi-lib-android-rqes-ui:$version")
}
```

Replace `$version` with the latest released version from
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/eu.europa.ec.eudi/eudi-lib-android-rqes-ui)
or the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-lib-android-rqes-ui/releases) page.

## How to use

### 1. Configuration

Implement `EudiRQESUiConfig` to supply runtime configuration to the SDK.

| Property                  | Required | Default                            | Purpose                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `qtsps`                   | Yes      | —                                  | List of Qualified Trust Service Providers the user can pick from.      |
| `documentRetrievalConfig` | Yes      | —                                  | Certificate-trust policy for resolving remote documents (required even for local-only flows). |
| `translations`            | No       | English defaults built into the SDK | Override or extend localized strings.                                  |
| `themeManager`            | No       | Built-in light/dark theme          | Customize colors and typography (see [Theming](#theming-and-rebranding)). |
| `printLogs`               | No       | `false`                            | Enable Timber debug logging.                                           |

Example (mirrors the [`:test-app`](test-app/) reference implementation):

```kotlin
class RQESConfigImpl(val context: Context) : EudiRQESUiConfig {

    override val qtsps: List<QtspData>
        get() = listOf(
            QtspData(
                // Human-readable name shown in the QTSP picker.
                name = "Wallet-Centric",
                // QTSP CSC v2 endpoint.
                endpoint = "https://walletcentric.signer.eudiw.dev/csc/v2".toUriOrEmpty(),
                // Optional Timestamp Authority URL.
                tsaUrl = "https://timestamp.sectigo.com/qualified",
                // OAuth2 client credentials issued by the QTSP.
                clientId = "wallet-client-tester",
                clientSecret = "somesecrettester2",
                // Deep link the QTSP redirects to after authorization.
                // Must match the host-app intent filter (see section 3).
                authFlowRedirectionURI = URI.create("rqes://oauth/callback"),
                hashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithmOID.SHA_256,
            )
        )

    override val documentRetrievalConfig: DocumentRetrievalConfig
        get() = DocumentRetrievalConfig.X509Certificates(
            context = context,
            certificates = listOf(R.raw.my_certificate),
            shouldLog = BuildConfig.DEBUG,
        )

    // Optional — overrides for individual localized strings.
    override val translations: Map<String, Map<LocalizableKey, String>>
        get() = mapOf(
            "en" to mapOf(LocalizableKey.View to "VIEW")
        )

    override val printLogs: Boolean
        get() = BuildConfig.DEBUG
}
```

You can supply multiple `QtspData` entries; the user selects one in the options screen.

`documentRetrievalConfig` is required even if you only use the local-file flow, although
it only takes effect when resolving *remote* documents. Besides
`DocumentRetrievalConfig.X509Certificates` (shown above — trusts certificates bundled as
raw resources), you can pass `DocumentRetrievalConfig.X509CertificateImpl` with your own
`X509CertificateTrust`, or `DocumentRetrievalConfig.NoValidation` to skip certificate
validation (useful for local-only integrations or testing).

### 2. Setup

Call `setup()` once, typically from your `Application.onCreate()`. This wires the
SDK's Koin modules and applies your config.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        EudiRQESUi.setup(
            application = this,
            config = RQESConfigImpl(this),
            // Optional: if your host app already uses Koin, pass it here so the
            // SDK adds its modules to your application instead of starting its own.
            koinApplication = null,
            // Optional: get notified whenever a signing finishes, e.g. to keep a history.
            signingLogger = { record -> saveToHistory(record) },
        )
    }
}
```

The optional `signingLogger` is called every time a signing finishes, with a record of what happened:
the outcome, the serial number of the certificate that signed, and each document's label, digest and
size — never the signed files themselves. It is the `RqesSigningLogger` of the
[RQES Core library](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-lib-android-rqes-core), whose
documentation describes the record in full and when the logger is and is not called.

### 3. Deep link registration

The SDK relies on the system browser for OAuth and (optionally) a deep link for
same-device document retrieval. Register the corresponding intent filters on the
Activity that should receive them.

#### OAuth callback

This must match the `authFlowRedirectionURI` set in `QtspData`. For
`URI.create("rqes://oauth/callback")`:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

    <!-- scheme is the literal scheme without "://" -->
    <data
        android:scheme="rqes"
        android:host="oauth"
        android:path="/callback" />
</intent-filter>
```

Alternatively, you can use [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing).

#### Document retrieval (same-device flow)

Only needed if you support the remote-URL flow. The host app receives the remote
URL via this deep link and passes it to `EudiRQESUi.initiate(remoteUri = ...)`.

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

    <data
        android:scheme="your_scheme"
        android:host="your_host" />
</intent-filter>
```

### 4. Host Activity setup

The Activity that hosts the deep-link filters needs two things, otherwise the
return from OAuth will not work:

- **`android:launchMode="singleTask"`** in the manifest so the existing instance
  receives the deep link instead of launching a new one.
- An **`onNewIntent` override** that extracts the `code` query parameter from the
  OAuth callback and forwards it to `EudiRQESUi.resume(...)`.

```kotlin
class HostActivity : ComponentActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        checkIntent(intent)
        // ... your normal setContent { } here
    }

    override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) {
        super.onNewIntent(intent)
        checkIntent(intent)
    }

    private fun checkIntent(intent: Intent) {
        val code = intent.data?.getQueryParameter("code")
        if (code != null) {
            EudiRQESUi.resume(
                context = this,
                authorizationCode = code,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Initialization

#### Local file

Start the signing process with the URI of a local PDF (for example, one returned
by `ActivityResultContracts.OpenDocument`).

```kotlin
EudiRQESUi.initiate(
    context = activity,
    documentUri = DocumentUri(fileUri),
)
```

#### Remote URL for document retrieval

Start the signing process with a remote URL (for example, extracted from a QR
code or the document-retrieval deep link above).

```kotlin
EudiRQESUi.initiate(
    context = activity,
    remoteUri = RemoteUri(remoteUri),
)
```

In both cases, the SDK opens its own Activity (`EudiRQESContainer`) and drives the
flow until either the success screen completes or the user cancels.

## Theming and rebranding

The SDK renders its screens with **its own Material 3 Compose theme** — your host
app's theme is not applied to them. It automatically follows the system light/dark
setting and shows the matching color set (Material You dynamic color is not used).

You can rebrand the SDK along three independent axes, all wired through your
`EudiRQESUiConfig`:

| What you change      | How                                                  | Types / resources                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Colors & typography  | Override `themeManager`                              | `ThemeManager.Builder`, `ThemeColorsTemplate`, `ThemeTypographyTemplate` |
| Header logo          | Shadow the SDK drawable in your app module           | `ic_logo_icon_and_text`                                    |
| Text & labels        | Override `translations`                              | `LocalizableKey` (see [Configuration](#1-configuration))   |

> The public theming types live under `eu.europa.ec.eudi.rqesui.infrastructure.theme`
> (and its `templates` / `templates.structures` sub-packages). The SDK's built-in
> palette and typography are `internal`, so you build your own templates rather than
> tweaking the defaults.

### Colors and typography

Override the `themeManager` property and assemble a `ThemeManager` with the builder.
Colors are passed as a `ThemeColorsTemplate` (one for light, optionally one for dark);
fonts and text styles as a `ThemeTypographyTemplate`.

```kotlin
override val themeManager: ThemeManager
    get() = ThemeManager.Builder()
        .withLightColors(brandLightColors)
        .withDarkColors(brandDarkColors)   // optional — light colors are reused if omitted
        .withTypography(brandTypography)
        .build()
```

**Colors.** Every Material 3 role is required (there are no per-field defaults). Values
are ARGB `Long` literals, e.g. `0xFF2A5FD9`:

```kotlin
private val brandLightColors = ThemeColorsTemplate(
    primary = 0xFF2A5FD9,
    onPrimary = 0xFFFFFFFF,
    primaryContainer = 0xFFEADDFF,
    onPrimaryContainer = 0xFF21005D,
    secondary = 0xFFD6D9F9,
    // … provide every remaining role: the secondary/tertiary/error families,
    // background, surface and the surface*/surfaceContainer* slots, outline, scrim,
    // the inverse* roles and the *Fixed accent roles.
)
// private val brandDarkColors = ThemeColorsTemplate( … )
```

See `ThemeColorsTemplate` for the full list of roles to fill in.

**Typography.** All 15 text styles must be supplied. Each `ThemeTextStyle` field is
optional and falls back to Compose defaults when omitted. Bundle your font files under
`res/font` and reference them via `ThemeFont`:

```kotlin
private val brandFont = ThemeFont(
    res = R.font.my_brand_font,
    weight = ThemeFontWeight.W400,
    style = ThemeFontStyle.Normal,
)

private val brandTypography = ThemeTypographyTemplate(
    headlineSmall = ThemeTextStyle(
        fontFamily = listOf(brandFont),
        fontSize = 24,
        lineHeight = 32,
        letterSpacing = 0f,
        textAlign = ThemeTextAlign.Start,
    ),
    // … provide the remaining styles: display{Large,Medium,Small},
    // headline{Large,Medium}, title{Large,Medium,Small},
    // body{Large,Medium,Small} and label{Large,Medium,Small}.
)
```

> A few internal accent colors (success, warning, divider) are not part of
> `ThemeColorsTemplate` and cannot currently be themed.

### Header logo

The header/success area shows a single logo drawable, `ic_logo_icon_and_text`, which
combines the mark and the wordmark. It is not exposed through config — rebrand it by
**shadowing the resource**: declare a drawable with the same name in your app module and
it overrides the SDK's at resource-merge time.

```
your-app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_logo_icon_and_text.xml
```

Within the drawable, the wordmark paths use `?colorOnSurface`, so the text adapts to
light/dark automatically, while the mark carries its own brand colors. Optionally
override the `content_description_logo_icon_and_text` string for accessibility.

### Text and labels

All user-facing copy is overridden through `translations` (shown in
[Configuration](#1-configuration)): map any `LocalizableKey` to your own wording. For
keys that take runtime arguments, keep the `@arg` placeholder (the `ARGUMENTS_SEPARATOR`
token) where the value should be inserted — for example
`LocalizableKey.Certificate to "Cert @arg"`.

## Error handling

The SDK exposes errors via `EudiRQESUiError`, a subclass of `Exception`. Methods
that can throw it are annotated with `@Throws(EudiRQESUiError::class)`:

- `EudiRQESUi.initiate(...)` — thrown if the document URI's filename cannot be
  extracted or if the remote URI is malformed.
- `EudiRQESUi.resume(...)` — thrown if the SDK was not initiated first (no active
  signing session — i.e. `initiate(...)` was never called), or if the supplied
  `context` is not an Activity.

Failures that happen *inside* the SDK's UI (network errors during OAuth,
certificate listing, signing, etc.) are surfaced on the in-SDK error screen and
do not propagate out to the host app.

## Sample app

The [`:test-app`](test-app/) module is a complete, runnable host application that
demonstrates every integration point: a configured `EudiRQESUiConfig`, deep-link
registration, Activity wiring, and both local-file and remote-URL flows. It is
the canonical reference if anything in this README is ambiguous.
